<P>
This document describes how to build <A HREF="http://cegcc.berlios.de">CeGCC</A>.
One chapter deals with building the software on Linux,
another focuses on <A HREF="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</A> (Windows + the Cygnus layer).
<H1>Building on Linux</H1>

<H2>Directory structure</H2>
<P>
<H2>Things to modify</H2>
<P>
Theoretically you should be able to use the scripts
and have to modify only the <i>settings.sh</i> script.
That script contains exported shell variables for
<table>
<tr><td>SCRIPTDIR</td><td>should automatically point to the scripts/linux directory</td></tr>
<tr><td>TOP_SRCDIR</td><td>should automatically point to the top directory containing CeGCC</td></tr>
<tr><td>BUILD_DIR</td><td>this points to a temporary directory in which all of the build happens</td></tr>
<tr><td>PREFIX</td><td>By default, this is <i>/usr/ppc</i>. You should set it to suit your needs, this is where the tools get installed. (<i>GNU default would be /usr/local</i>).</td></tr>
<tr><td>MY_HOST_ARCH</td><td>This is the architecture on which we're building</td></tr>
<tr><td>TARGET_ARCH</td><td>This is the target architecture, for our project that's <i>arm-wince-pe</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The scripts also includes $PREFIX/bin in the path
to make sure that the newly built executables can be used
by the other scripts in the build process.
<H2>Script concepts</H2>
<P>
All scripts reside in $SCRIPTDIR, that's scripts/linux in your distribution.
The build.sh script is the master build script.
<P>
<font color=red>Beware: build.sh will initially clean up</font>
the complete $BUILD_DIR
but also the contents of most of the $PREFIX.
There's a small protection : it'll only clean up in $PREFIX if that's equal to /usr/ppc .
<P>
The tools need to be built in a sequence because they rely on each other.
One of the sequences that works (the one we use) is :
<ul>
	<li>binutils
	<li>includes
	<li>gcc
	<li>newlib
	<li>libraries
	<li>gdb
	<li>the debugging stub
	<li>g++
</ul>
<P>
In this sequence, we always (configure and) build the tools,
then immediately install them in $PREFIX.
This is uncommon, but is the easiest way for us to deal with this sequence.
Sadly, this conflicts with the concept of e.g.
<A HREF="http://www.rpm.org">rpm</A>
so it is not possible to create a source RPM for this project in a simple way.
<H2>Hacks to work around problems</H2>
<H3>Not enough ranlib-bing</H3>
<P>
<H3>C++ compiler won't build</H3>
<P>
For some reason, the build process for the C++ compiler chokes.
The only explanation - and workaround - that we know of is the one found in
<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/1997-06/msg00457.html">this old message</A>
saying
<font color=blue><pre>
Configure creates a softlink in gcc object directory to the new
version of the cross assembler. Problem is that the native compiler
get confused and use the cross assembler instead of the native one.
</pre></font>
<P>
We adapted the build-gpp.sh script for this : it'll configure, and then build everything.
But the build is expected to fail (so the script won't terminate on this occasion),
then $BUILD_DIR/gpp/gcc/as is removed (that's the file bothering us),
then the build is restarted.
