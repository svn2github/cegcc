<TITLE>How to build the toolchain</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<img src="../images/banner1.png" alt="CeGCC cross compiler for PocketPC">
<P>
This document describes how to build <A HREF="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net">CeGCC</A>.
We have a set of scripts that can be used to build the toolchain on
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org">GNU/Linux</A> as well as on 
<A HREF="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</A> (Windows + the Cygnus layer).
These scripts are in the <I>src/</I> directory, they're called
<I>src/build-cegcc.sh</I> and
<I>src/build-mingw32ce.sh</I>.
They can be used to build the toolchain for the <I>arm-wince-cegcc</I>
and <I>arm-wince-mingw32ce</I> target platforms, respectively.
<P>
We used to have a separate set of scripts in the <I>scripts/linux</I> directory.
These have been removed.
The only thing still left there is support for building <A HREF="http://www.rpm.org">RPM</A> files,
these are distribution packages that can be used on many Linux platforms.
<P>
We offer two similar implementations of our product.
They're called after the target platforms they represent :
<ul>
	<li><i>arm-wince-cegcc</i> is meant for building apps that rely on a UNIX-style operating system, system calls, etc.
	<li><i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i> is much closer to Windows CE, for apps using the native API.
</ul>
<P>
The examples below all mention the <i>arm-wince-cegcc</i> target.
When building for the <I>arm-wince-mingw32ce</I> target,
replace <i>cegcc</i> by <i>mingw32ce</i> everywhere, e.g. :
<PRE>
	sh build-mingw32ce.sh
</PRE>
<H1>1. Building on Linux</H1>
<P>
This chapter describes building the toolchain on Linux.
I would guess that this is similar on Cygwin,
but the details on that are in the next chapter.
<A HREF="#common">A third chapter</A> in this document describes some common elements,
you probably want to look into that.
<P>
The basic steps are very simple :
<ul>
	<li>Put yourself in the right directory</li>
	<li>Clean up old installations</li>
	<li>Build it</li>
</ul>
<H2>1.1 The right directory</H2>
<P>
All of the commands and context below rely on the fact that you're in the
<I>src</I> directory of the <A HREF="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net">CeGCC</A>
distribution.
<H2>1.2 Clean up old installations</H2>
<P>
Cleanup is recommended :
<PRE>
	rm -rf /opt/cegcc/*
	rm -rf build-cegcc
</PRE>
<H2>1.3 Build cegcc completely</H2>
<P>
<PRE>
	sh build-cegcc.sh
</PRE>
<P>
This command will rebuild and install all of cegcc.
The directory in which everything is installed is <I>/opt/cegcc</I>,
which means that you'll need to put <I>/opt/cegcc/bin</I> in your PATH
to make use of the new tools.
<H2>1.4 More complicated stuff : partial builds, etc</H2>
<P>
The build scripts have a couple of paramters.
In this chapter, we'll explain how to use them.
<P>
When you pass the <i>--help</i> parameter to the build script,
it'll display a summary of its usage :
<PRE>
	dannypc: {55} sh build-cegcc.sh --help
	Using defaults:
	Building cegcc:
	source: /home/danny/src/cegcc/svn.sf.net/cegcc/trunk/cegcc/src
	build: /home/danny/src/cegcc/svn.sf.net/cegcc/trunk/cegcc/src/build-cegcc
	prefix: /opt/cegcc
	usage:
	build-cegcc.sh [source dir] [build directory] [prefix dir] [build_opt]
	 
	Valid build options : binutils importlibs w32api dummy_cegccdll
	  bootstrapgcc newlib gcc cegccdll cegccthrd libstdc++ gdb
	  gdbstub docs profile all

	Done. --------------------------
</PRE>
<H3>1.4.1 Partial builds</H3>
<P>
You can rebuild part of CeGCC by saying e.g.
<PRE>
	sh build-cegcc.sh gcc
</PRE>
The script will then only build and install the requested module.
<H3>1.4.2 Non-standard prefix</H3>
<P>
<B>Warning</B> : don't install CeGCC in a generic installation directory
such as /usr/local . 
<H3>1.4.3 </H3>
<H1>2. Building on Cygwin</H1>
<P>
To be written by someone who knows about Cygwin...
<A NAME="#common"><H1>3 Platform independent information</H1></A>
<H2>3.1 How the scripts interact</H2>
<H2>3.2 Installation directory</H2>
<H2>3.3 The quick overview : how to build a cross compiler</H2>
<P>
The tools need to be built in a sequence because they rely on each other.
The text below is an overview to make you understand the issues involved,
the real scripts (src/build-*.sh) are the most
<I>(the only?)</I> reliable source of information on this topic.
<ul>
	<li>binutils
	<li>includes
	<li>gcc <font color="red">bootstrap</font>
	<li>newlib
	<li>dll <font color="red">preliminary, not thread-capable</font>
	<li>CE libraries
	<li>gcc, g++ <font color="red">complete build</font>
	<li>dll <font color="red">complete</font>
	<li>additional libraries (threads support, C++ DLLs)
	<li>gdb
	<li>the debugging stub
</ul>
<P>
In this sequence, we always (configure and) build the tools,
then immediately install them in $PREFIX.
This is uncommon, but is the easiest way for us to deal with this sequence.
<H1>4. Requirements</H1>
<P>
There is nothing out of the ordinary in the tools you need to build cegcc,
most free software packages require the same :
<ul>
	<li> a working C and C++ compiler for your platform, only tested with gcc
	<li> make
	<li> (if you're building an RPM) the rpmbuild tool
</ul>
<P>
You don't need automake, autoconf or such tools : the cegcc sources,
even the ones in SVN,
already contain the files generated by these tools.
Note that we need to do this as some of the software that is part of cegcc
requires different revisions of the auto tools than other parts of cegcc.

<H1>6 Known problems</H1>
<H2>6.1 C++ compiler won't build</H2>
<P>
For some reason, the build process for the C++ compiler chokes.
The only explanation - and workaround - that we know of is the one found in
<A HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/1997-06/msg00457.html">this old message</A>
saying
<font color=blue><pre>
Configure creates a softlink in gcc object directory to the new
version of the cross assembler. Problem is that the native compiler
get confused and use the cross assembler instead of the native one.
</pre></font>
<P>
We found that this only happens if you have the current directory in your PATH,
usually in the beginning of the list (before /bin and such).
A workaround is to remove . from your path, or to put it at the end.
<P>
We've adapted the build scripts so they can cope with this,
but this is really a gcc bug.
<H2>6.2 Build sometimes fails</H2>
I recommend cleaning up the installation directory and all of the build
directories prior to using the build scripts.
The build tends to be less reliable if part of an old build is still present.
