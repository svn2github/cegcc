<H1>The unix-like layer provided by CeGCC</H1>
<P>
Apart from the well known tools (binutils, gcc, newlib, ..)
that we publish as being the important parts of the CeGCC project,
there is also quite an important piece of
WinCE specific
code.
Most of that is in the directory <i>src/newlib/newlib/libc/sys/wince</i>
even though it is not a part of the standard newlib distributions.
<P>
Part of this code is required to be able to create executables that start
a program in a consistent way (e.g. crt0.o, the startup code in an executable),
but another part of this code provides a unix like layer
with functionalities absent in Windows CE.
<P>
The purpose of this document is to describe all that,
it is based on the only other documentation we could find :
<i>the source</i>.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<h2>File descriptors</h2>
<h2>Current directory</h2>
According to the
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directory.getcurrentdirectory.aspx">
Microsoft website</a>,
Windows CE doesn't support the current directory functionality.
<p>
However, some of the XCE functions in the newlib library that we provide
do support such functionality.
The startup code (see <i>src/newlib/newlib/libc/sys/wince/startup.c</i>)
sets up an environment variable PWD which it presets
to either the current directory from the parent process,
or the path extracted from the executable file we're running.
Similarly a PATH variable is also put in the environment.
