<BODY>
<P>
This document describes how to cross-compile Windows CE applications
using the tools provided by <A HREF="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net">the CeGCC project</A>.
Part of this document is dependent on the host environment,
another part is generic.
<P>
What does that sentence mean ?
The host environment is the environment in which you compile your sources
to produce an executable that can run on Windows CE.
The CeGCC project actively supports two such environments :
<UL>
<LI>a Windows environment with <A HREF="http://cygwin.com">Cygwin</A>
<LI>a Linux environment
</UL>
<P>
<H1>Getting started</H1>
<P>
In this chapter, we'll show how to compile a very simple source.
<H2>Simplistic example</H2>
<P>
You can type or copy-and-paste this source :
<P>
<PRE>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

int WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPWSTR lpCmdLine, int nCmdShow)
{
          MessageBoxW(0, L"HELLO!", L"H3LLO!", 0);
}
</PRE>
<P>
We've created a file named <B>dialog.c</B> that contains this code.
To compile it, run this command :
<P>
<PRE>
arm-wince-cegcc-gcc -o dialog.exe dialog.c
</PRE>
<P>
Beware - you'll need to have the CeGCC DLLs installed on your PDA if you want to
run this application.
Read about that in <A HREF="dll.html">the DLL document</A>.
<H2>Commands provided</H2>
<p>
All the cross-commands have the names that are formed by using their target platform
as a prefix, and the tool name as a suffix.
For our case, the target platform is called <b>arm-wince-cegcc</b>
which means we're building for an <b>ARM</b> processor,
running the <b>wince</b> operating system,
and producing <b>pe</b> executable files
to be linked with the CEGCC library.
An example : the C compiler is called arm-wince-cegcc-gcc .
<p>
PE stands for Portable Executable file format,
and it's 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/system/platform/firmware/PECOFF.mspx">Microsoft's implementation of COFF</a>
(the Common Object File Format).
<a href="http://www.arm.com">ARM</a> is a RISC processor family
which is found in many embedded systems,
also implemented by Intel as their
<a href="http://www.intel.com/design/intelxscale">Xscale</a>
processor line.
Wince is shorthand for the 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsce">Windows CE</a> operating system.
Windows CE is the technology base for environments such as
PocketPC, Smartphone, and
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile">Windows Mobile</a>.
<p>
In an apparent attempt to complicate matters,
we implement not only the <b>arm-wince-cegcc</b> target (see above),
but also the <b>arm-wince-mingw32ce</b> target.
<a href="http://www.mingw.org">MinGW</a> is a free software project implementing a
<b>Minimalist GNU for Windows</b>.
We're using this target to build applications that merely use the Windows CE API,
not our CeGCC (newlib based) library.
(<i>Note that this is neither a full nor an official port of MinGW.</i>)
<p>
We used to have a target called <i>arm-wince-pe</i> but renamed that to <i>arm-wince-cegcc</i>
for consistency.

<H1>How to build a Makefile that works</H1>
<p>
A Makefile is a description of how to build something that depends on other sources.
We're using it for building executables from program sources, which is its most common use.
<p>
<H2>A sample Makefile</H2>
<PRE>
ARCH=		arm-wince-cegcc
CC=		${ARCH}-gcc ${CFLAGS}
WINDRES=	${ARCH}-windres

CFLAGS=		-g -D_WIN32_IE=0x0400

menu-resource.exe:	menu-resource.o menu-resource.rsc
	${CC} -o $@ menu-resource.o menu-resource.rsc -lcommctrl

menu-resource.o:	menu-resource.c
	${CC} -c $?

menu-resource.rsc:	menu-resource.rc menu-resource.h
	${WINDRES} $? $@

clean:
	-rm -f *.o *.exe *.rsc
</PRE>
<p>
To give you something to play with, all of the files for this example have been put
online :
<ul>
<li><a href="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/docs/examples/Makefile">Makefile</a>
<li><a href="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/docs/examples/menu-resource.c">menu-resource.c</a>
<li><a href="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/docs/examples/menu-resource.rc">menu-resource.rc</a>
<li><a href="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/docs/examples/menu-resource.exe">menu-resource.exe</a>
<li><a href="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/docs/examples/menu-resource.h">menu-resource.h</a>
<li><a href="http://cegcc.sourceforge.net/docs/examples/menu-resource.tar.gz">all those : menu-resource.tar.gz</a>
</ul>
<p>
The executable should work on any suitable PDA.
With the menu, you should be able to create a simple line drawing and quit the application.
<h2>How does it work</h2>
<p>
Well, we're not going to explain how <i>Make</i> works,
you can read stuff like
<a href="http://www.eng.hawaii.edu/Tutor/Make/">this make tutorial</a>
for that.
In your Makefile, you'll have to specify that the <i>arm-wince-cegcc</i> tools need to be used.
Mixing your host platform's tools with these ones will have surprising results,
you'll need to make sure that you cover all the tools required.
For instance, that's the reason why I've overriden the CC variable:
all calls to the C compiler will be dealt with in this way.
An obvious hole is that any C++ source would trigger the C++ compiler,
which is probably still g++, not arm-wince-cegcc-g++, because we've not specified
<pre>
CXX=	${ARCH}-g++
</pre>
<p>
Failure to do so could produce this :
<pre><font color=green>
dannypc: {136} make t.exe
g++ -O   -c -o t.o t.C
arm-wince-cegcc-gcc -g -D_WIN32_IE=0x0400 -o t.exe t.o
t.o: file not recognized: File format not recognized
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
gmake: *** [t.exe] Error 1
rm t.o
</font></pre>
<p>
That's because this generated a t.o file meant for (in my case) a Linux Pentium system,
and the arm-wince-cegcc linker can't cope with that.
<p>
An important thing to know about Windows is that applications consist of program sources
(in languages such as C or C++),
but also of resource files.
The traditional linker command line for UNIX and its lookalikes would only gather
a bunch of .o files and libraries
to combine them into an executable file.
On Windows, there's a binary form of resource files that needs to be put in the exe files
in the same way as the .o files.
As you can see in the sample Makefile,
<ul>
	<li>the resource sources are in a .rc file
	<li>the tool to compile them is called windres
	<li>the binary/compiled form is a .rsc file
	<li>the linker will accept .rsc files and .o files
</ul>
<p>
The actual run of a make command might look like this :
<pre>
% make menu-resource.exe
arm-wince-cegcc-gcc -D_WIN32_IE=0x0400   -c menu-resource.c
arm-wince-cegcc-windres menu-resource.rc menu-resource.rsc
arm-wince-cegcc-gcc -D_WIN32_IE=0x0400   -o menu-resource.exe menu-resource.o menu-resource.rsc -lcommctrl
% 
</pre>
<H2>Using the arm-wince-mingw32ce target</H2>
<p>
The only difference with all the above is the name of all the tools.
You can still call e.g. the compiler in the same way, it just has a slightly different name.
The Makefile that you can <a href="">download</a> (see above)
is actually slightly larger than described here.
Issuing a simple <i>make</i> command will also run compile commands such as :
<pre>
arm-wince-mingw32ce-gcc -o hello-small.exe hello-dialog.c
</pre>
which creates an executable which only calls Windows CE's coredll,
not the CeGCC DLL (cegcc.dll).

<h2>Use of Unicode</h2>
Many applications are currently still coded to cope with one-byte characters.
Several operating systems have been providing support for both that traditional way of working,
and a more general approach.
Windows CE is special in that it only supports Unicode in many of its API's.
This means that an application that wants to create a file must pass the file name as
a Unicode string.
Obviously this means that either the application must be converted to use Unicode
throughout, or to convert strings to and from Unicode when necessary.
In the latter case, standard APIs such as
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/functions/mbstowcs.html">mbstowcs</a>
and
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/functions/wcstombs.html">wcstombs</a>
can be used.
<p>
An important warning : the locale definition is not the same on all systems.
If you write applications that cooperate with each other across system boundaries, 
be sure to exchange data only in formats that are truly portable.
An example : the wide character encoding on my PDA has two bytes per character,
on my Linux system it has four.
GDB (actually the arm-wince-cegcc-gdb cross-debugger) and its stub are each working on
one of those systems,
and they're exchanging data as wide characters. 
That's rather silly off course, the multibyte encoding is better at exchanging data.
For the tools to work together,
it was necessary to create special functions that convert strings to and from the PDA format.
This was not necessary for the same to work between the PDA and Cygwin
(I'm guessing that desktop Windows uses the same format as Windows CE).
<h2>Notion of current directory</h2>
According to the
<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.directory.getcurrentdirectory.aspx">
Microsoft website</a>,
Windows CE doesn't support the current directory functionality.
<p>
However, some of the XCE functions in our newlib library
do support such functionality.
(Only in the <i>arm-wince-cegcc</i> target.)
The startup code (see <i>src/newlib/newlib/libc/sys/wince/startup.c</i>)
sets up an environment variable PWD which it presets
to either the current directory from the parent process,
or the path extracted from the executable file we're running.
Similarly a PATH variable is also put in the environment.
<p>
More information about this is in
<a href="layer.html">The unix-like layer provided by CeGCC</a>.
<h2>Standard C functions that aren't supported</h2>
The functions supporting the <i>long double</i> type aren't supported by Windows.
strtold is an example of that, replace it by strtod if you can.
