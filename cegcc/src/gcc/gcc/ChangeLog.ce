	* config/arm/cegcc.c : Delete. We use the originals instead.
	This code is generic PE code, and will hopefully get
	pushed down to a more general place in GCC 4.3 stage1.
	* cegcc-cxx.c : Likewise.
	* cegcc-stubs.c : Likewise.
	* config.gcc : Use the originals instead of the new copies for the 
	arm*-wince-cegcc case.
	* config/arm/t-wince-cegcc : Make it empty, we now inherit the generic
	t-wince-pe.
	* ChangeLog.ce : New file.
