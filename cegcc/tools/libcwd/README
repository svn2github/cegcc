This is a cwd lib for WinCE.

This is a lib that serves as a porting aid.  It provides chdir and
getcwd calls, thus a current working directory notion.

Note that this lib is built as a static lib, so be careful with
linking the lib into several dlls/exe.  Don't expect the same cwd
to be seen across dlls.  For that to work, you'll need to build a
libcwd.dll.

Have fun!
