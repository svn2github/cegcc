		   README for rcp for Windows CE

This directory contains rcp for Windows CE.

This tool was written based on the rcp extension to 
"rshd - Remote Shell Daemon for Windows NT version 1.6" written by
Silviu C. Marghescu (http://www.cs.umd.edu/~silviu).  The rcp
extension was written by Gary Doss (gdoss@rpspo2.atlantaga.ncr.com).

The rcp part was totally separated from Silviu's rshd, and converted
to read/write from/to stdin/stdout.  It is supposed to be invoked from
rshd for WinCE with stdin/stdout/stderr redirected, much like a unix
version of rcp would do.

To build make sure you have the mingw32ce toolchain on your path, and
type make.

Have fun!
